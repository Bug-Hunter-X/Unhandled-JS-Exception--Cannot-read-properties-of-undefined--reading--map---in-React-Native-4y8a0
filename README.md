This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')'.  The error arises when attempting to iterate over an array (using .map) before the array has been populated.  The solution involves using optional chaining (?.) and the nullish coalescing operator (??).
